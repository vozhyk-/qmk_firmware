# vozhyk-'s keymap for ErgoDash

## Features

- Numbers shifted to the left so that (QWERTY) `1`, `2`, `3` are in the same position as on a row-staggered keyboard when holding Hyper or Shift with the left pinky.
- `'`(QWERTY `z`) replaced with `Shift`, so that `Shift` is accessible by bending the left pinky down, like on a row-staggered keyboard.
- Hardware Programmer Dvorak-like layout - mapped to QWERTY keys and using macros to have different shifted and non-shifted keycodes.
- Modes for languages:
  - Belarusian (Latin) (mapped to Belarusian Latin QWERTY) with accented characters rearranged.
  - Polish (mapped to Polish QWERTY and Polish Programmer Dvorak) with macros for the "sz", "cz", "rz" combinations.
  - Japanese with keys for switching Japanese input modes.
- Swap-hands and a mode for using it with both hands
- Ergoemacs-like Navigation layer
- A Symbol layer with symbols placed at Programmer Dvorak-like finger positions
- A macro for switching tabs in most-recently used order with Control-Tab
